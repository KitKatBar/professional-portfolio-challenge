# Professional Portfolio Challenge - My First Website!

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With that in mind, let us set ourselves up for success by applying all the core skills that we have learned within a week.  Creating a website from scratch in a few days is no easy feat.  Some companies take weeks, maybe even months to design their own professional webite.  However, constant practice and repition of our skills is something that everyone can do.  With the right mindset and effort, we'll be able to create something that can be presented to our potential employers in the future!  This will be an exciting task that challenges us to make a name for our careers.

## Installation

No installation is required!  This code has been deployed to GitHub Pages so that you can view it on your own device.  To do so, please visit the following link: https://kitkatbar.github.io/professional-portfolio-challenge/

## Usage

Please refer to these images showing the layout of the application.  Please note that what you see in the sample images may slightly differ from your own viewing perspective.

For larger devices: https://github.com/KitKatBar/professional-portfolio-challenge/blob/main/assets/images/sample-layout-large-size.png?raw=true

For medium devices: https://github.com/KitKatBar/professional-portfolio-challenge/blob/main/assets/images/sample-layout-mid-size.png?raw=true

For smaller devices: https://github.com/KitKatBar/professional-portfolio-challenge/blob/main/assets/images/sample-layout-small-size.png?raw=true

When you first load the webpage, you will be presented with an avatar of myself and a navigation bar on the top right.  Depending on the size of your device, you may also see a banner of San Jose, representing where I am currently from.  Hovering over my avatar will enlarge it slightly with a short animation, but this is only for aesthetic purposes.  The navigation bar should all link to their respective sections when you click on them.  This also comes with a nice hover animation for each of the links.  Currently, clicking on 'Resume' will not take you anywhere.

You will see an 'About Me' section, detailing my career and journey so far, and what I am most looking forward to getting out of in this Bootcamp.

In the 'Projects' section, you will see various projects that I have worked on in the past.  The first project will be displayed larger relative to all the other projects.  Hovering over each project will give a little highlight and enlarging animation.  Clicking on one of the projects will bring you to the application's deployed website.  Note that not all projects are deployed.  For the ones that aren't, clicking on them will bring you to the codebase repository on my GitHub account.

In the 'Contact' section, you will see icons of various social medias.  Hovering over each icon will give a little enlarging animation.  Clicking on one of the icons will bring you to my social media page where you can find me.  For email, clicking on the icon will open up whichever mail application you are using and autofill the recipient to my email address.  For phone, clicking on the icon will open up your phone application, but I am currently not giving out my number so please don't call me randomly (you can't even if you tried).

Any other sites that I used for reference that I forgot (oops!).

Google Images for providing all the images and icons I needed to design my website.

Our instructor Drew Hoang for teaching basically a Web Development 101 class all in one week and giving us advice and his thought process on how to start creating a website from scratch.  This was very helpful as it simplifies what was initially thought to be a complicated task by breaking down each portion and tackling them on one at a time rather than the whole thing at once.  His speed-run videos are also very insightful for providing information and for reviewing class material.

Our TA Kyle Vance for his continued guidance during class and taking the time to explain how he would tackle practice problems.  One of the important skillsets I remembered from the week was learning how to create wireframes and I believe that this is especially important for making a website from scratch.  He was very helpful in showing us the tools that he used, his thought process in imagining how he would want his website to look like, and creating an excellent template reference that will help create the real thing.
