                    Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Katriel Chiu and I am an aspiring
                    software developer. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and
                    a minor in Computer Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Eventually,
                    I ended up moving to San Jose and worked at the United States Patent & Trademark
                    Office. After working there for a little over 4 years, I realized that this was
                    not my lifelong passion. Coupled with having to adjust to remote work and the
                    influence of the COVID-19 outbreak at its peak, I made the uneasy decision to
                    quit and I wanted to pursue my dreams of working in technology once again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some self study and going through a training program, I miraculously landed a
                    software developer contract role for a year. However, this was a humbling experience
                    that made me realize that technology had drastically changed over the years since I
                    got my degree. After a period of unsuccessful job hunting, I realized that I needed to
                    be educated with the modern type of technolgies that companies are looking for and ended
                    up here in the Coding Boot Camp offered by the University of California at Berkeley
                    Extension. Here, I hope that I will be able to learn many new things that can help that
                    can kick-start my new career. I welcome all who see this to be witnesses to my journey.
                </p>
